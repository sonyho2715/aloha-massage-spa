## 🎯 Next Steps - Build Booking System

Now that the database is ready, you can build:

### **Phase 1: Basic Booking Form** (Recommended Next)

Create a simple booking page that:
1. Shows available services
2. Customer fills in name, email, phone
3. Selects date/time
4. Submits → Saves to Railway PostgreSQL
5. Shows confirmation message

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create `/app/book/page.tsx` (booking form)
2. Create `/app/api/bookings/route.ts` (API to save booking)
3. Connect to Railway using existing .env.local
4. Test locally
5. Deploy to Vercel

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

---

### **Phase 2: Admin Dashboard**

View and manage bookings:
- See all upcoming appointments
- Confirm/cancel bookings
- View customer history
- Export to CSV

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

---

### **Phase 3: Enhancements**

- Email confirmations (SendGrid/Resend)
- SMS reminders (Twilio)
- Payment integration (Stripe/Square)
- Calendar sync (Google Calendar)
- Customer portal (view own bookings)

---

## 💰 Railway Costs

**Current Setup:**
- PostgreSQL database
- **Cost**: $5/month (Railway Hobby Plan)
- **Includes**: 500 hours execution time + database

**Your database is small**, so costs will stay at $5/month for the foreseeable future.

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

✅ **.env.local is gitignored** - Your database password is safe
✅ **SSL enabled** - All connections are encrypted
✅ **Railway backups** - Automatic daily backups

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **If connection fails:**

1. **Check .env.local** - Make sure DATABASE_URL is correct
2. **Test connection** - Run `npm run test-db`
3. **Verify Railway** - Check Railway dashboard shows database is running

### **If you need to reset database:**

```bash
# Drop all tables and re-import
psql "$DATABASE_URL" < database/schema.sql
```

### **If you want to add more services:**

```sql
INSERT INTO services (name, description, duration_minutes, price_usd, category, display_order)
VALUES ('Hot Stone Massage', 'Relaxing massage with heated stones', 90, 120.00, 'massage', 5);
```
